#  Chilli Configuration
#
#  To configure chilli, see /opt/Wive-MT/user/chillispot/coova-chilli-1.3.0/filesystem/etc/chilli/default
#  and then create your own /opt/Wive-MT/user/chillispot/coova-chilli-1.3.0/filesystem/etc/chilli/config
#  start / stop chilli with /chilli

#
#  This file can either contain all your chilli configurations, or include
#  other files, as shown per default below. The idea here is that main.conf
#  contains your main configurations, hs.conf is for your configurations
#  delivered by RADIUS (using the Administrative-User login), and local.conf 
#  is for any other settings you might configure by hand for this particular
#  installation.
