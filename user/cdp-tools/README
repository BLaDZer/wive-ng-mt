cdp-tools is a set of tools for working with the Cisco Discovery Protocol.

they were written because of a particular hosting center that insisted on
learning routes using CDP, and thusly required Cisco Switches for doing their
dirty work.

cdp-listen/cdp-routemgr are proof-of-concepts that may be useful if you want
to implement a similarly brain-damaged proposal.

cdp-send is a must-have tool if you are in that situation. It can pretend to
be just about any kind of Cisco hardware you can imagine.


the source is a bit difficult to follow as a requirement was that it build
under both the ancient libnet and the new libnet code. hence, much nasty
macro-ing.
