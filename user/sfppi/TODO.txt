- Add password support for eeproms with passwords
- Add feature to upload eeprom dump image file
- Support tuning of tunable SFP+/XFP. I expect this may not be possible, as one tunable XFP I have tested returns to a default wavelength of 1550.12nm once power is removed. 
- remove Wiringpi library with i2c library
