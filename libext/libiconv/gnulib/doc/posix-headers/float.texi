Gnulib module: float

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The values of @code{LDBL_*} macros are incorrect on some platforms:
On OpenBSD 4.0, MirBSD 10, and BeOS, they are the same as the values of the
@code{DBL_*} macros, although @samp{long double} is a larger type than
@samp{double}.
On FreeBSD/x86 6.4, they represent the incorrect 53-bit precision assumptions
in the compiler, not the real 64-bit precision at runtime.
On AIX 7.1 with GCC 4.2 and on IRIX 6.5, they don't reflect the
``double double'' representation of @code{long double} correctly.
