platforms:
AIX.
@item

@item
The signal @code{SIGPIPE} is not defined on some platforms:

@item
The macros @code{SA_RESETHAND} and @code{SA_RESTART} are not defined
on some platforms:
NonStop.
@item
The type @code{sighandler_t} (a GNU extension) is not defined on most non-glibc
platforms:
MacOS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11,

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Many signals are not defined on some platforms:
mingw.
@item
The macros @code{SIGRTMIN} and @code{SIGRTMAX} expand to an expression of type
@code{long} instead of @code{int} on some platforms:
OSF/1 5.1.
@item
The macro @code{SIGBUS} is set to the same value as @code{SIGSEGV},
rather than being a distinct signal, on some platforms:
Haiku.
