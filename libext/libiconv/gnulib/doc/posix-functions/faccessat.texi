Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

This function is missing on some platforms:
glibc 2.3.6, MacOS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8,
AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw,
Interix 3.5, BeOS.
However, the replacement does not always take into account ACLs.  Also,
it is not safe to be used in libraries and is not multithread-safe.

There is an inherent race between calling this function and performing
some action based on the results; you should think twice before trusting
