Gnulib module: accept

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), the descriptors returned by
the @code{accept} function cannot be used in calls to @code{read},
@code{write}, and @code{close}; you have to use @code{recv}, @code{send},
@code{closesocket} in these cases instead.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes for @code{accept}
are not placed in @code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be
used instead.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On BeOS, the descriptors returned by the @code{accept} function cannot be used
in calls to @code{read}, @code{write}, and @code{close}; you have to use
@code{recv}, @code{send}, @code{closesocket} in these cases instead.
@item
Some platforms don't have a @code{socklen_t} type; in this case this function's
third argument type is @samp{int *}.
